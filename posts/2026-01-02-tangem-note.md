# Tangem Wallet Promo

Happy New Year everyone.  
Hope 2026 brings health, happiness, and a little mining luck to those who could really use it.

I just wanted to post something quick to start the year.

I use a **[Tangem](https://tangem.com/pricing/?promocode=PROOFOFMIKE&promocode=NYEXTRA26)** wallet day to day, and they’re running a pretty solid promo right now.

If you’ve been thinking about buying one but kept putting it off, this is probably the time to do it.

Right now Tangem wallets are **20% off** and they’re also giving **$10 in Bitcoin** as a reward.  
The rings are discounted even more at **25% off**.

To get the full deal, you just need both promo codes applied:
`PROOFOFMIKE` and `NYEXTRA26`

If you use this link, both codes fill in automatically:  
[https://tangem.com/pricing/?promocode=PROOFOFMIKE&promocode=NYEXTRA26](https://tangem.com/pricing/?promocode=PROOFOFMIKE&promocode=NYEXTRA26)

Otherwise, you can just type them in manually at checkout — they stack.

If you were already planning to buy one at some point, the timing’s good.  
The promo runs through **January 19**.

Here’s to a calm start to 2026 and keeping custody where it belongs.
