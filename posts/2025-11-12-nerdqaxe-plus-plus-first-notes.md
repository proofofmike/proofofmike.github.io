# NerdQaxe++: first notes

Got a new miner today — first impressions are build quality and thermals are rock solid. Running quick solo-mining tests and logging settings here for future me.

- Pool: CKPool
- Start freq/voltage: TBD
- Noise notes: shockingly chill with desk placement

More details soon.
