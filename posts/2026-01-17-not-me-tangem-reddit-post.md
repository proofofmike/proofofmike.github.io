# Someone Used My Code on Reddit. It Wasn't Me.

Woke up to a Reddit post in r/Tangem pushing a discount code with my brand name on it.

Only problem is, it wasn’t me.

Different account. Not mine. Not associated with me. Just someone using my code and my name in a way that makes it look like I posted it.

I’m not here to make it a bigger thing than it is. I just wanted to put it on record that the post didn’t come from me.

## 🧾 What I Did About It

I kept it simple:

- Reported the post
- Messaged the mods
- Took screenshots
- Moved on

No back and forth. No drama. Just the right steps so there’s a clear paper trail.

## 🧠 Why I Take This Seriously

I’ve been online since the 90s and in Bitcoin since 2014.

Back when most people didn’t even know what spam was, I was writing anti spam tools for Exim and dealing with abuse issues the hard way. That stuff tends to wire you a certain way.

So yeah, I’m a firm believer in community guidelines. If I’m posting somewhere, I try to follow the rules and keep things respectful.

## ✅ Bottom Line

That Reddit post was not me.

I reported it, contacted the mods, and moved on. This post is here for one reason: clarity.
