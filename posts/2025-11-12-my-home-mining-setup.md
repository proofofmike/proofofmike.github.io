# What I’m Running at Home: Real Hashrates, Setup, and Daily Averages

A lot of people ask what I’m actually running at home, what my hashrates look like in real daily averages, and which miners I genuinely prefer after running them nonstop.

This is a straight breakdown of my current home setup — no cherry-picked 5-minute spikes, just realistic 24-hour averages.

---

## 🧱 My Current Setup (~15.9–16.1 TH/s Daily)

Right now I'm running:

- **NerdQaxe++ Remastered (full copper) ×2**
- **Bitaxe Hex**
- **Bitaxe Gamma 601**

Across all four units, my true 24-hour combined average sits around **15.9–16.1 TH/s**.

This is what I use for modeling solo-mining odds and tracking long-term performance.

### Miner-by-miner daily averages:

**NerdQaxe++ Remastered (full copper)**  
- nerd1 — **≈ 6.13 TH/s**  
- nerd2 — **≈ 5.98 TH/s**

**Bitaxe Hex**  
- hex — **≈ 2.96 TH/s**

**Bitaxe Gamma 601**  
- gamma — **≈ 1.09 TH/s**

> Note: I see occasional hourly spikes above **17 TH/s**, but daily averages are the number that matters.

## 🧱 NerdQaxe++ Remastered (Full Copper)

These are the workhorses of my setup — stable, cool, and consistently around **6 TH/s** each in real-world daily averages.

Before CKPool wiped my stats and before I took them down for cleaning, I had even steadier long-term runs above 6 TH/s. After a reset, it always takes a while for the long averages to rebuild.

And yeah — the **red PCB and orange fan** look awesome on a desk.

## 🔶 Bitaxe Hex (stock settings)

I keep my Hex at stock settings mainly for one reason: **noise**. It’s close to where I sit, and pushing it harder isn’t worth the extra airflow.

- **Daily avg:** ~2.96 TH/s

It’s a strong middle-tier miner for people who want more than a single-chip device but don’t want to turn their house into an ASIC wind tunnel.

---

## 🔹 Bitaxe Gamma 601

This one’s the easiest miner to live with — quiet, simple, predictable.

- **Daily avg:** ~1.09 TH/s

I leave it on stock settings too.

If someone wants an entry miner that won’t take over their entire setup, this is still one of the most user-friendly.

---

## ⚡ Total Daily Hashrate

Putting everything together:

- **Total daily average:** **15.9–16.1 TH/s**

This is the number I track for solo-mining, variance planning, and long-term monitoring.

---

## 🏆 My Favorite Miner (personal take)

Purely for my own setup and workflow:

### **The NerdQaxe++ Remastered (full copper) is my favorite miner.**

It combines:

- excellent thermals  
- stable performance  
- beautiful PCB + fan aesthetics  
- low headaches  

If I had to rebuild from scratch, I’d start with these.

## 📌 What I’ll Cover Next

Over the next few posts, I’m planning to write about:

- Noise comparisons (real decibels measured at my desk)
- Overclocking vs. efficiency tuning
- Hourly vs. daily hashrate variance explained clearly
- Best miners for absolute beginners
- Solo-mining strategy at 16 TH/s
- Real cost-to-run based on Massachusetts electricity pricing

If you want me to cover something specific, let me know on X (@ProofOfMike).
