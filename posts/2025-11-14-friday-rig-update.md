# Friday Rig Update — Dialing In My Desk Mining Setup

It’s Friday… the Patriots punished the Jets last night… and my little team of miners is almost silently grinding away.

I’ve been tinkering more than I probably should the last couple of weeks, but everything is finally dialed in exactly how I want it. **Uptime is king**, so I’m done touching anything that requires a reboot for a while. Any changes from here on out will be coordinated with my next cleaning cycle.

The home mining setup on my desk has already evolved a bit since my [“What I’m Running”](/posts/2025-11-12-my-home-mining-setup.html) post. I started pushing one of the **NerdQaxe++ Remastered Full Copper** units harder, and once I saw what it could really do, I realized it deserved its own dedicated write-up — especially now that I’ve tuned it into the **quietest 6 TH/s miner I’ve ever owned**.

I’ve also reorganized how everything sits on the desk: the dual-fan **Bitaxe Hex**, the **Bitaxe Gamma 601** in the orange stand, and the twin full-copper **NerdQaxe++** units all have their own roles now. Power draw is balanced, airflow is clean, and the whole cluster runs quieter than most gaming PCs. The Gamma 601 is still a bit louder than I’d like, so fixing that is on the list when I have time.

If you’re curious about **real hashrate**, **temps**, **noise**, or **day-to-day solo-mining stability**, I just published a full breakdown with photos and tuning notes.

This is the first real deep dive I’ve done on one of my miners — but based on early results, it definitely won’t be the last.
