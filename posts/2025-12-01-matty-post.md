# How My High School Sports-Betting Buddy Became My Bitcoin Mining Tech Support

I originally wrote a quick story on my personal Facebook about how my high-school sports-betting crew somehow ended up in Bitcoin mining. It blew up with comments, laughs, and “this is too real” messages.

So I cleaned it up, expanded it, and turned it into a proper page that fits the style of this site.

It covers twenty years of bad beats, miracle covers, emotional damage from parlays, and now somehow… Bitcoin miners on the kitchen counter.

And at the center of the chaos is Matty — my long-time betting partner, degenerate extraordinaire, and full-time Sunday headache.

**Matty, if you’re reading this:**  
You might be a pain in the ass…  
but you’re *my* pain in the ass. 🤣

If you’ve ever sweated a parlay, screamed at a TV, or believed “just one more leg will hit,” you’ll feel right at home.

Thanks for reading — and if you got here from the story, welcome to the ProofOfMike universe. More mining, more madness, and more questionable life decisions coming soon.
