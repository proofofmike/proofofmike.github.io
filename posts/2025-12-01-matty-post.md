# How My Sports-Betting Buddy Jumped Into Bitcoin Mining

I originally wrote a short, funny post on my personal Facebook about how one of my longtime sports-betting friends — Matty — somehow turned the corner from sweating parlays to sweating block finds. The post blew up with comments, so I turned it into a proper page on my site.

If you want to read the full version, it’s here:

It’s a quick look at how someone who’s been betting games with me since high school suddenly fell headfirst into Bitcoin solo mining — and how similar the “sweat” feeling is between sports and blocks.

Matty, if you ever read this: you might drive me crazy, but you’re still my guy. 😂
