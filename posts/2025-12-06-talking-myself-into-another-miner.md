# Talking Myself Into Another Miner Today

I’ve been watching college football all afternoon, getting ready for UFC later, and doing what every hobby miner does when they’re left unsupervised for more than ten minutes:

**opening four tabs and convincing myself I need another miner.**

Truth is, I don’t need one.  
My setup is fine.  
Hashrate is fine.  
Electricity bill… definitely not fine, but that’s another conversation.

But I keep staring at my NerdQaxe++ Remastered Copper.

I already have two of them — and I swear every time I walk past my desk I think, *man, that thing just looks ridiculous*. The red PCB, the burgundy shroud, the orange fan, all that copper… My kid is sick of hearing me say, “Look how awesome that thing looks,” but he doesn’t get it. This is art.

So now I’m in that internal battle:

Do I actually need more hashrate?  
No.  
Is that going to stop me?  
Probably not.

If I end up grabbing another one, it’s going to be the same model I already reviewed — you can see that write-up here:

It just fits my setup perfectly. And let’s be honest — if I’m writing this, the decision is already 90% made.
