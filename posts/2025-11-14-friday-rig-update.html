      <p>
        It’s Friday… the Patriots punished the Jets last night… and my little team of miners is almost silently
        grinding away.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve been tinkering more than I probably should the last couple of weeks, but everything is finally dialed in
        exactly how I want it. <strong>Uptime is king</strong>, so I’m done touching anything that requires a reboot for
        a while. Any changes from here on out will be coordinated with my next cleaning cycle.
      </p>

      <p>
        The home mining setup on my desk has already evolved a bit since my
        <a href="/posts/2025-11-12-my-home-mining-setup.html">“What I’m Running”</a> post. I started pushing one of the
        <strong>NerdQaxe++ Remastered Full Copper</strong> units harder, and once I saw what it could really do,
        I realized it deserved its own dedicated write-up — especially now that I’ve tuned it into the
        <strong>quietest 6TH/s miner I’ve ever owned</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve also reorganized how everything sits on the desk: the dual-fan <strong>Bitaxe Hex</strong>, the
        <strong>Bitaxe Gamma 601</strong> in the orange stand, and the twin full-copper <strong>NerdQaxe++</strong>
        units all have their own roles now. Power draw is balanced, airflow is clean, and the whole cluster runs quieter
        than most gaming PCs. The Gamma 601 is still a bit louder than I’d like, so fixing that is on the list when I
        have time.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re curious about <strong>real hashrate</strong>, <strong>temps</strong>, <strong>noise</strong>, or
        <strong>day-to-day solo mining stability</strong>, I just published a full breakdown with photos and tuning
        notes.

      <p>
        This is the first real deep dive I’ve done on one of my miners — but based on early results, it definitely
        won’t be the last.
