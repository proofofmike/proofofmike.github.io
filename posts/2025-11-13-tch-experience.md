# My Experience With TinyChipHub (Shipping & Support)

I’ve ordered three miners from TinyChipHub over the past few months — two NerdQaxe++ units and a Bitaxe Hex.  
Since I mention them sometimes, I wanted to write something quick about what the experience has actually been like.

## 📦 Shipping to Massachusetts

All three orders showed up in **about a week**.  
No drama, tracking updated normally, and everything arrived fast considering it’s coming from overseas.

## 🛠️ The One Issue I Had

On my first order, **customs opened one of the boxes**, and the stand/fan combo inside ended up cracked.

I wasn’t looking for anything special — I simply asked if I could *buy* a replacement.

They shipped me a new one right away, **no charge**, and didn’t make it a whole back-and-forth.  
Honestly, that’s all I expect from customer support anywhere: just handle it and move on.

## ⚙️ Hardware Reliability

Everything I’ve bought from them has been solid.  
Both NerdQaxe++ units run steady at ~6 TH/s, and the Bitaxe Hex sits around ~3 TH/s.

No weird crashes or thermal surprises so far.

## 👍 Final Thoughts

Nothing fancy here — just my experience as an actual customer:

- Shipping was quick  
- Support was straightforward  
- The miners all work as expected  

I’m planning to grab another unit soon. This hobby turns addictive fast.
