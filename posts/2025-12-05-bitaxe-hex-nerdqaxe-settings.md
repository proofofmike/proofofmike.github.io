# My Bitaxe Hex & NerdQaxe++ Settings (Now on GitHub)

Every time I post miner pics or hashrate screenshots, I get the same messages:

> “What frequency are you running?”  
> “What voltage?”  
> “What are your temps?”  
> “Can you share your NerdQaxe / Hex config?”

Instead of rewriting it in DMs, I finally pushed everything into a small public GitHub repo:

👉 **[Bitaxe Hex & NerdQaxe Settings Repo](https://github.com/proofofmike/bitaxe-hex-nerdqaxe-settings)**

The repo includes:

- My **Bitaxe Hex** daily-driver settings  
- My **NerdQaxe++ Remastered Copper** settings  
- Frequency, voltage, fan modes, temperature targets  
- Notes on stability, temps, and tuning approach  

These are the exact settings I run on my home desk rig. Nothing theoretical, nothing from a spreadsheet — just what works reliably on my hardware.

## Why I Posted This

A lot of people are buying Bitaxe and NerdQaxe miners as desk rigs now, and most “official” tuning info is spread out across Discord chats, Reddit replies, or screenshots.  
This repo gives anyone a simple baseline to work from.

I’ll keep it updated anytime I change something or try a new tuning profile.

## If You're Shopping for One of These Miners

Both of my miners came from **TinyChipHub** (sometimes written as *Tiny Chip Hub*).  
If you're thinking about picking one up:

You can use my code:

> **PROOFOFMIKE** = **5% off** eligible Bitaxe, NerdQaxe++, and Zyber miners.

Full breakdown of their lineup is here:

## More Mining Notes

I keep a running log of solo-mining results, hashrates, tuning experiments, and the occasional bulldog photo at:

👉 **[ProofOfMike.com](https://proofofmike.com/)**

If you want to see the rigs in action, temps, noise levels, and how they behave in a real desk setup — that’s where I post everything long-form.
