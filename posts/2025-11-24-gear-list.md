# New Bitaxe / NerdQaxe gear page

I keep getting the same questions on X, Reddit, and Discord about accessories:

What thermal paste should I use?  
Which Noctua fan fits the Bitaxe?  
Which Mean Well PSU makes sense for a small desk farm?  
What XT30 cable or fuse do I actually need?

For a while I had all of this stuffed into a messy Apple Note and copy-pasted links whenever someone asked. This weekend I finally cleaned it up and turned it into a proper page:

👉 https://proofofmike.com/gear

Here’s what’s on the list:

- Noctua fans  
- AC Infinity spot-coolers  
- Mean Well PSUs  
- XT30 + barrel pigtails  
- Thermal paste and pads  
- Fuses  
- Dusting tools  
- A tiny “canary” temperature sensor  
- Misc repair tools and cables  

I’ll keep the list updated as I add new miners or find better accessories. If something ends up being trash, I’ll pull it — simple as that.

If I missed anything or you’ve found something better, drop me a line at **@ProofOfMike** on X.
