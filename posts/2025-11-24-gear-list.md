I’ve had a bunch of people on X, Reddit, and Discord ask me the same questions over and over:

• “What thermal paste do you use?”  
• “Which Noctua fan fits the Bitaxe?”  
• “What Mean Well PSU should I buy?”  
• “Which XT30 cable do I need?”  
• “What fuse does the NerdQaxe++ use?”  

For the longest time I kept all of this in a messy Apple Note.  
Every time someone asked, I’d scroll around, find the right link, copy/paste it…  
and then forget where I left off.

So this weekend I finally cleaned it all up and dumped the full list into a proper page:

👉 **https://proofofmike.com/gear**

It’s everything I actually use or that’s been recommended to me by people I trust:
— Noctua fans  
— AC Infinity spot-coolers  
— Mean Well PSUs  
— XT30 + barrel pigtails  
— Thermal paste and pads  
— Fuses  
— Dusting tools  
— A tiny “canary” temperature sensor  
— Plus some misc repair tools and cables

I’ll keep the list updated as I add new miners or find better accessories.  
If something ends up being trash, I’ll pull it — simple as that.

If I missed anything or you’ve found something better,  
**drop me a line at @ProofOfMike on X.**
