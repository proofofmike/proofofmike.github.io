# Clean Your Miners. Seriously.

Yesterday I took all my rigs down for a quick cleaning.

When I say “cleaning,” I don’t mean pulling them apart and doing surgery. I mean I **power them down**, let them sit for about **10 minutes to cool off**, take them outside, and hit them with a **can of compressed air**.

I try to keep a set schedule, but life happens. Sometimes I go longer than I’d like. Yesterday was the end of one of those stretches. I noticed my temps had slowly started to creep up, and while I didn’t really notice the extra noise day to day… after cleaning?

**WOW.** It was **much** quieter.

That’s the whole point of this post: **clean your miners.**

Frequent quick cleanings with compressed air help you avoid the annoying version of cleaning… the one where you’re breaking out little brushes and Q-tips to scrape dust off fan blades and heatsinks. It also helps prolong the life of the equipment, keeps temps under control, and improves quality of life if your miners are anywhere near where you actually live.

And mine are. This is a normal house setup: dog hair, kid chaos, regular home dust. These things get dirty.

Do yourself a favor and grab a cheap can of compressed air. I use Dust-Off and it makes a world of difference:

Quick cleanings beat deep cleanings every time.
