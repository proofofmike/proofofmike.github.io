      <h1>Best Bitcoin Wallets for Real People (Not Crypto Degens)</h1>
      <p class="page-intro">
        I’m Mike (“Proof of Mike”). I’ve been around Bitcoin since 2015 and I like simple setups that actually
        work in real life — not 15-step rituals you forget the second you need to move coins.
      </p>
      <p class="page-intro">
        On this page I break down three wallets I’m comfortable recommending:
        <strong>Trezor Safe 7</strong>, <strong>Ledger Flex</strong>, and the <strong>Tangem card</strong>.
        Each has a different “sweet spot” depending on how you use Bitcoin and crypto.

          <h2>Trezor Safe 7 – The “grown-up” cold storage pick</h2>
          <p>
            If you want a wallet that feels like a proper vault for your Bitcoin and main coins,
            <strong>Trezor Safe 7</strong> is the one I’d lean toward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trezor’s whole thing is transparency: open-source firmware, simple interface, and a long track record.
            It’s not trying to be flashy — it’s trying to be boring and reliable, which is exactly what you want
            for a device that holds real money.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Great for long-term BTC and major coins</li>
            <li>✅ Standard recovery phrase backup (easy to store offline)</li>
            <li>✅ Trezor Suite app is clean and not overloaded with casino-style nonsense</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <a href="https://affil.trezor.io/SHxI" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="cta-button">

          </p>
          <p class="small-note">
            If you only ever end up holding Bitcoin and a couple large caps, Safe 7 can realistically be your
            “one and done” hardware wallet.

          <h2>Ledger Flex – For people deep in crypto ecosystems</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Ledger Flex</strong> is the “I live in crypto” option. If you’re the type bouncing between
            chains, tokens, DeFi, NFTs, and whatever the flavor of the month is, this is where Ledger really shines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Flex combines Ledger’s security chip with a thin, flexible form factor and an e-ink display that’s
            actually pleasant to read. It plays well with a ton of wallets and apps.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Huge coin and token support</li>
            <li>✅ Clean e-ink screen and modern feel</li>
            <li>✅ Good choice if you’re not “Bitcoin-only”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p class="small-note">
            If you’re already using Ledger Live or see yourself jumping into lots of altcoins, Flex is the most
            convenient long-term choice.

          <h2>Tangem Card – Your “everyday carry” crypto wallet</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Tangem</strong> is totally different from Trezor and Ledger. It’s a physical card — more like a
            debit card than a USB device. You tap it to your phone (NFC), use the Tangem app, and that’s it.
          </p>
          <p>
            By default, you never see a recovery phrase. Instead, you activate multiple cards into the same wallet,
            and those extra cards are your backup. Lose one card? The others still work.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Feels familiar — like a bank card, not a gadget</li>
            <li>✅ Great for people who will <em>actually</em> lose a paper seed phrase</li>
            <li>✅ Perfect for smaller stacks, spending money, or travel backup</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <a href="https://tangem.com/invite/26T37H" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="cta-button">

            </a>
          </p>
          <p class="small-note">
            You can turn on a more traditional seed-phrase mode if you really want it, but Tangem is designed so
            normal people don’t have to think about 24 words at all.

      <h2>So… which one am I personally using?</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a big believer in matching the tool to the job:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cold storage / “do not touch” stack:</strong> Trezor-style device (Safe 7 lane).</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment / DeFi / “I’m clicking on weird links” sandbox:</strong> Ledger lane.</li>
        <li><strong>Everyday carry:</strong> Tangem card in the physical wallet, for small balances only.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The important thing is not which brand you pick — it’s that you actually
        <strong>get coins off exchanges</strong> and into something you control.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you end up grabbing one of these using my links, thank you. It genuinely helps me keep testing hardware,
        mining, and sharing honest numbers instead of influencer fluff.
