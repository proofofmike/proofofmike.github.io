        <p>
          If you’re new to Bitcoin hobby mining today, everything looks clean and obvious: point a Bitaxe at a pool URL,
          open a dashboard, watch shares roll in. Back when I came into the space — late 2014 — everything felt different.
        </p>
        <p>
          The community lived on Bitcointalk. Code lived in long threads. Arguments, breakthroughs, bug fixes, trust
          relationships — all of it happened out in the open. It reminded me of very early Bugtraq mixed with EFnet IRC
          fights and just enough brilliance to keep the whole thing from collapsing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And although I wasn’t around for the earliest era, you couldn’t be active in 2014 without absorbing the history
          that got us there.

          <h2>The Very Beginning — Solo or Nothing</h2>
          <p>
            In Bitcoin’s earliest days, mining literally started inside the Bitcoin client itself. There was a simple UI
            checkbox — <strong>“Generate Coins”</strong> — and your CPU did the rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wasn’t there for that era, but you’d still hear veterans tell stories about it on Bitcointalk. It was a
            completely different universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            As difficulty rose, people needed something better, and that’s where the first dedicated mining tools appeared.

          <h2>cpuminer — The First Real Tool</h2>
          <p><em>Created by Jeff Garzik</em></p>
          <p>
            Before specialized hardware and before the modern ecosystem, there was <strong>cpuminer</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was simple, command-line, accessible, and you could aim it at:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>your own local <code>bitcoind</code></li>
            <li>early pooled services once they emerged</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It proved the concept: mining could happen outside Bitcoin Core, and external tools could meaningfully
            contribute to the network.
          </p>

        <section id="slush" class="card origin-card">
          <h2>Slush Pool — The First Breakthrough in Pooled Mining</h2>
          <p><em>Created by Marek Palatinus (Slush), originally mining.bitcoin.cz</em></p>
          <p>
            Before anyone could imagine today’s global mining operations, one person made a simple but revolutionary leap:
            <strong>What if miners didn’t have to compete alone?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Around late 2010, Slush launched the first Bitcoin mining pool — <strong>Slush Pool</strong>. Difficulty was
            climbing fast, and miners running CPUs (and soon GPUs) were going long stretches without rewards.
          </p>
          <p>His idea fundamentally changed everything:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>miners combined hashrate</li>
            <li>work was distributed</li>
            <li>payouts were shared proportionally</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It sounds obvious now, but back then it was groundbreaking.</p>
          <p>Slush introduced concepts still used today:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>share difficulty</li>
            <li>share validation</li>
            <li>predictable reward systems (precursors to PPS, PPLNS, etc.)</li>
            <li>centralized work coordination so miners could submit partial proofs efficiently</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It turned mining from a lottery into something reliable.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="cgminer" class="card origin-card">
          <h2>cgminer — A Tool That Defined Multiple Eras</h2>
          <p><em>Created by Con Kolivas (CK)</em></p>
          <p>
            <strong>cgminer</strong> became the tool nearly everyone used through the hardware transition era.
          </p>
          <p>It supported:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>GPUs</li>
            <li>FPGAs</li>
            <li>the early waves of ASIC hardware</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            cgminer wasn’t pool software — it ran on your mining hardware. But its stratum behavior, drivers, workload
            handling, monitoring, and tuning philosophies shaped how miners and pools interacted for years.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="my-entry" class="card origin-card">
          <h2>How I Entered the Scene (Late 2014)</h2>
          <p>
            By the time I arrived in late 2014, ASICs were firmly in control.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found my way onto Bitcointalk, bought my first miner, and fell straight down the same rabbit hole everyone
            hits:
          </p>
          <p>You start with one device. Then another. Then another “just to validate my ROI math.”</p>
          <p>Before long you’ve turned part of your home into a mini datacenter.</p>
          <p>My real hardware lineup eventually included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spondoolies SP35</li>
            <li>Spondoolies SP20E</li>
            <li>Bitmain S5s</li>
            <li>Bitmain C1 w/ cooling kit</li>
            <li>Bitcrane T110-S units</li>
            <li>Bitmain S4</li>
            <li>an early Bitmain S9</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I didn’t run a polished operation — I ran a garage.</p>
          <p>
            It became a roaring, overheated chamber — half sauna, half airport runway. Some guys had man caves with sports
            memorabilia. I had bread racks, floor-scattered miners, ziptied cables everywhere, my central A/C hacked into
            the garage, and a garage door permanently cracked open in winter just to manage the heat.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Beautiful chaos.</strong></p>

        <section id="ck-stack" class="card origin-card">
          <h2>The CK Stack &amp; solo.ckpool.org — Evolving Together</h2>
          <p><em>Created by Con Kolivas (CK) with contributions from others</em></p>
          <p>
            This is the part newer miners tend to misunderstand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, people hear “CKPool” and think only of the pooled-solo endpoint. But the pool was only one piece of a
            broader ecosystem that grew organically over years.
          </p>
          <p>The CK toolkit eventually included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>ckpool</strong> — efficient pool engine</li>
            <li><strong>ckdb</strong> — high-performance backend database</li>
            <li><strong>ckproxy</strong> — aggregation layer for huge miner counts</li>
            <li><strong>libck</strong> — shared C utility library used across CK’s components</li>
            <li>various monitoring, routing, and utility components</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And here’s the important part:</p>
          <p>These tools and the solo pool evolved together.</p>
          <p>
            Some components existed in rough form before the pool launched in 2014. Others were written because the pool
            needed them. Still others matured long after, as traffic grew and hardware evolved.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t a top-down roadmap — it was an organic evolution inside a rapidly changing ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p>
            CK and Slush — at completely different moments and for completely different reasons — helped shape the future
            of Bitcoin mining long before anyone realized how significant their contributions would become.

          <h2>solo.ckpool.org — Solo Mining Without Running the Stack</h2>
          <p>
            The arrival of <strong>solo.ckpool.org</strong> changed everything for solo miners.
          </p>
          <p>For the first time, you could solo-mine without:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>running your own node</li>
            <li>maintaining a mempool</li>
            <li>managing block templates</li>
            <li>hosting your own stratum server</li>
            <li>keeping infrastructure online 24/7</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you found the block, you got the full reward (minus a small fee).</p>
          <p>
            It preserved the purity of solo mining while removing the operational burden — and for hobbyists and even some
            very large farms, that combination was magic.

          <h2>The Culture of Bitcointalk (2014–2016)</h2>
          <p>Back then, everything happened on Bitcointalk:</p>

            <li>firmware</li>
            <li>hardware sales</li>

          <h2>Modern Solo Mining — Many Paths, Same Foundations</h2>
          <p>
            By 2025, the mining landscape is unrecognizable compared to earlier eras.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Slush Pool → Braiins Pool (still running)</li>
            <li>solo.ckpool.org (still nearly unchanged since 2014)</li>

            <li>scams</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Too many to catalog — and not the point of this story.</p>
          <p>
            If someone wants full sovereignty today, they can still run Core/Knots from source, maintain their own
            mempool, run their own stratum, and build the entire stack. That path never left.
          </p>
          <p>What has changed is simply the volume of choices.</p>
