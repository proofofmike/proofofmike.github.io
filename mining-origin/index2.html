          <h2>Setting the scene (2014)</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re new to Bitcoin hobby mining today, everything looks clean and obvious: point a
            Bitaxe at a pool URL, open a dashboard, watch shares roll in. Back when I came into the
            space — late 2014 — everything felt different.
          </p>
          <p>
            The community lived on Bitcointalk. Code lived in long threads. Arguments,
            breakthroughs, bug fixes, trust relationships — all of it happened out in the open. It
            reminded me of very early Bugtraq mixed with EFnet IRC fights and just enough brilliance
            to keep the whole thing from collapsing.
          </p>
          <p>
            And although I wasn’t around for the earliest era, you couldn’t be active in 2014
            without absorbing the history that got us there.
          </p>

          <h2 class="origin-section-title">The very beginning — solo or nothing</h2>
          <p>
            In Bitcoin’s earliest days, mining literally started inside the Bitcoin client itself.
            There was a simple UI checkbox — <strong>“Generate Coins”</strong> — and your CPU did
            the rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wasn’t there for that era, but you’d still hear veterans tell stories about it on
            Bitcointalk. It was a completely different universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            As difficulty rose, people needed something better, and that’s where the first dedicated
            mining tools appeared.

            Before specialized hardware and before the modern ecosystem, there was
            <strong>cpuminer</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>It was simple, command-line, accessible, and you could aim it at:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>your own local <code>bitcoind</code></li>
            <li>early pooled services once they emerged</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It proved the concept: mining could happen outside Bitcoin Core, and external tools
            could meaningfully contribute to the network.

            Slush Pool — the first breakthrough in pooled mining
          </h2>
          <p class="muted">
            <span class="origin-meta-label">Created by:</span> Marek Palatinus (Slush), originally
            <code>mining.bitcoin.cz</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Before anyone could imagine today’s global mining operations, one person made a simple
            but revolutionary leap:
            <strong>What if miners didn’t have to compete alone?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Around late 2010, Slush launched the first Bitcoin mining pool — Slush Pool. Difficulty
            was climbing fast, and miners running CPUs (and soon GPUs) were going long stretches
            without rewards.
          </p>
          <p>His idea fundamentally changed everything:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>miners combined hashrate</li>
            <li>work was distributed</li>
            <li>payouts were shared proportionally</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It sounds obvious now, but back then it was groundbreaking.</p>
          <p>Slush introduced concepts still used today:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>share difficulty</li>
            <li>share validation</li>
            <li>predictable reward systems (precursors to PPS, PPLNS, etc.)</li>
            <li>
              centralized work coordination so miners could submit partial proofs efficiently
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>It turned mining from a lottery into something reliable.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>cgminer</strong> became the tool nearly everyone used through the hardware
            transition era.
          </p>
          <p>It supported:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>GPUs</li>
            <li>FPGAs</li>
            <li>the early waves of ASIC hardware</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            cgminer wasn’t pool software — it ran on your mining hardware. But its stratum
            behavior, drivers, workload handling, monitoring, and tuning philosophies shaped how
            miners and pools interacted for years.

        <section class="card origin-card" id="how-i-entered">
          <h2 class="origin-section-title">How I entered the scene (late 2014)</h2>
          <p>By the time I arrived in late 2014, ASICs were firmly in control.</p>
          <p>
            I found my way onto Bitcointalk, bought my first miner, and fell straight down the same
            rabbit hole everyone hits:
          </p>
          <p>
            You start with one device. Then another. Then another
            <em>“just to validate my ROI math.”</em> Before long you’ve turned part of your home
            into a mini datacenter.
          </p>
          <p>My real hardware lineup eventually included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spondoolies SP35</li>
            <li>Spondoolies SP20E</li>
            <li>Bitmain S5s</li>
            <li>Bitmain C1 w/ cooling kit</li>
            <li>Bitcrane T110-S units</li>
            <li>Bitmain S4</li>
            <li>an early Bitmain S9</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I didn’t run a polished operation — I ran a garage.</p>
          <p>
            It became a roaring, overheated chamber — half sauna, half airport runway. Some guys
            had man caves with sports memorabilia. I had bread racks, floor-scattered miners,
            ziptied cables everywhere, my central A/C hacked into the garage, and a garage door
            permanently cracked open in winter just to manage the heat. Beautiful chaos.

            CK’s pool code &amp; solo.ckpool.org — evolving together
          </h2>
          <p class="muted">
            <span class="origin-meta-label">Created by:</span> Con Kolivas (CK)
          </p>
          <p>This is the part newer miners tend to misunderstand.</p>
          <p>
            Today, people hear “CKPool” and think only of the pooled-solo endpoint. But the pool
            was only one piece of a broader effort that grew organically over years.
          </p>
          <p>
            CK’s pool engine (<code>ckpool</code> + <code>libckpool</code>) showed what a lean,
            efficient Bitcoin pool could look like without a massive corporate footprint. It was a
            focused codebase and an operational model for running a minimal-trust pool in the real
            world. You can still see echoes of that philosophy in how modern solo setups and
            lightweight pools are designed today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, CK also built and refined <strong>solo.ckpool.org</strong> itself — the
            pooled-solo endpoint most people know today. The pool logic, payout behavior, and
            operational model evolved alongside the code, shaped by real-world traffic, hardware
            changes, and lessons learned from keeping a pool online for more than a decade.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was, for example, a separate database project (<code>ckdb</code>) written by a
            different developer. It was used for a time, but CK later removed it entirely and does
            not maintain or support it today. The long-lived core is <code>ckpool</code>,
            <code>libckpool</code>, and the solo endpoint — not a big external “toolkit,” but a
            tight pool engine and an operational philosophy that’s stood the test of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            CK and Slush — at completely different moments and for completely different reasons —
            helped shape the future of Bitcoin mining long before anyone realized how significant
            their contributions would become.

          <p>
            The arrival of <strong>solo.ckpool.org</strong> changed everything for solo miners.
          </p>
          <p>For the first time, you could solo-mine without:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>running your own node</li>
            <li>maintaining a mempool</li>
            <li>managing block templates</li>
            <li>hosting your own stratum server</li>
            <li>keeping infrastructure online 24/7</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you found the block, you got the full reward (minus a small fee).</p>
          <p>
            It preserved the purity of solo mining while removing the operational burden — and for
            hobbyists and even some very large farms, that combination was magic.

          <h2 class="origin-section-title">The culture of Bitcointalk (2014–2016)</h2>
          <p>Back then, everything happened on Bitcointalk:</p>

          <h2 class="origin-section-title">Modern solo mining — many paths, same foundations</h2>
          <p>
            By 2025, solo mining barely resembles the world of 2010–2015. The hardware evolved,
            the software stacks exploded, and the menu of “how to solo mine” options is wider
            than ever — but nearly all of it still rests on foundations built in the early eras.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Slush Pool became Braiins Pool</strong>, carrying forward the pooled-mining
            concepts Slush created in 2010 — predictable rewards, share validation, difficulty-based
            work, and coordinated distribution of block templates. The codebase is modernized, but
            the lineage is unmistakable.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>CKPool and CK’s solo endpoint</strong> continued to evolve quietly and
            efficiently. The architecture, the philosophy, and the “minimal trust surface” model
            remain familiar, but the backend has seen years of improvements: better infrastructure,
            refined code, performance tuning, and long-term operational hardening that only comes
            from running a pool for more than a decade.
          </p>

          <p>Around these pillars, the ecosystem exploded:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>hosted solo-mining services</li>
            <li>GUI node stacks and node appliances</li>
            <li>Dockerized mining environments</li>

            If someone wants full sovereignty today, nothing stops them from running Bitcoin
            Core or Knots from source, maintaining their own mempool, building templates locally,
            and running their own stratum server — the path is still there, unchanged in principle.
          </p>

          <p>
            What has changed isn’t the philosophy — it’s the number of choices layered on top of it.

          <p class="muted">
            This isn’t nostalgia for old software — the early tools shaped the mining world we still
            live in. Every modern pool, every solo-mining setup, every Stratum implementation carries
            pieces of this lineage.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Slush Pool</strong> created the first workable model for pooled mining: predictable
            rewards, difficulty-based shares, centralized work coordination, and the beginnings of what
            later became modern payout systems. Even though Braiins Pool has evolved dramatically from
            the original codebase, the <em>conceptual DNA</em> still traces back to Slush in 2010.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>cgminer</strong> defined how miners talk to pools. Its handling of work, stratum,
            hardware drivers, tuning philosophy, and monitoring expectations set the template for ASIC
            control software for years. Entire generations of miners were built assuming “the cgminer way”
            was the correct way — because for a long time, it was.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>CK’s pool engine</strong> showed what a lean, efficient Bitcoin pool could look like
            without a massive corporate footprint. It was a focused codebase and an operational model
            for running a minimal-trust pool in the real world. You can still see echoes of that
            philosophy in how modern solo setups and lightweight pools are designed today.
          </p>

          <p>
            And then there’s <strong>solo.ckpool.org</strong> — the first real pooled-solo setup (as
            most of us think of it today). It removed the operational burden for solo miners while
            preserving the purity of receiving the entire block reward directly. Hundreds of blocks,
            thousands of BTC paid out, and more than a decade of uptime have built a level of trust
            that simply can’t be forked or recreated.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            That’s why these names still matter. That’s why people still recommend CKPool. That’s why
            Braiins Pool still has loyal miners. The foundation wasn’t marketing — it was engineering,
            history, and reliability earned over years.
          </p>

          <p>
            When someone asks, “Why do people keep pointing new miners to CKPool?” the answer is simple:
            <strong>once you understand the history, the recommendation makes itself.</strong>

            This isn’t the official history — it’s how I remember it, entering in late 2014 and
            learning from the ecosystem that came before me.
          </p>
          <p>
            If CK or Slush ever read this, I’d love to know how close I got to the truth — they
            were the ones actually building the foundations the rest of us stood on.

          <p>
            <strong>Welcome.</strong> The tools are cleaner now, but the rabbit hole is just as deep
            as ever.
