            <h2>Full story</h2>

            <p>
              Me and Matty have been sports-betting degenerates together since high school — going on 20 years now.
              We’ve lived through heaters, heartbreaks, bad beats, miracle covers, blown parlays, and enough
              “one-leg-away” stories to last a lifetime. It’s basically our social circle at this point… the group
              chat, the trash talk, and the constant sweating of games we have no business watching.
            </p>

            <p>
              A few months back, while everyone was arguing about the early slate, I’m in the chat talking about
              hitting a Bitcoin block. They clown me for it, obviously. Then Matty hits me with:<br />
              <strong>“Bro… I kinda want in on that.”</strong>
            </p>

            <p>And that was the moment everything changed.</p>

            <p>
              He buys a miner.<br />
              Then another guy buys one.<br />
              Then another.<br />
              And suddenly I’m running unpaid tech support every weekend for grown men who still can’t figure out how to
              screenshot on their phone.
            </p>

            <p>Now every Sunday I’m juggling Red Zone with:</p>

            <p class="muted matty-small">
              “Mike, my miner’s stuck at 0.0 TH/s!”<br />
              “Mike, how do I flash firmware?”<br />
              “Mike, what’s a WebUI?”<br />
              “Mike, why does mine sound like a jet engine? Is it supposed to do that?”
            </p>

            <p>Meanwhile I’m just trying to watch the damn game.</p>

            <p>
              But honestly? Watching my friends get hooked on mining has been hilarious. It’s like watching my bulldog
              Bruiser try to jump on the couch — awkward, confused, determined… and somehow they still get there
              eventually.
            </p>

            <p>And now half of them care more about block height than the actual score.</p>

            <p>
              If you’re thinking about getting into mining like Matty did, this is the desk miner most of the guys
              ended up buying. And if you get stuck or have questions, hit me up on X — I’m always down to help out.
            </p>

            <p>
              Just don’t hit me up on Sundays. That’s basically my weekly Christmas, and it’s already packed with
              dealing with my idiot friends’ mining emergencies and their terrible bets.
            </p>

            <p>
              And if you’ve got an edge on a game, I’m always willing to take a shot too.
              Just don’t bother with unders… life’s too short.
